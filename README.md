Frankie here - developer, hockey(field) enthusiast and food fanatic.

I graduated university with a first class hons in Advertising & Brand Management and followed the path of account management, working for a marketing firm. I got involved with the business analysis of the company which led to working with the in-house developer more closely and from there my love for coding began and has flourished since joining Makers Academy in August 2016.

Having graduated the 16 week intensive bootcamp at Makers, I am looking for a **Junior Full Stack Developer** role in which I can delve deeper into expanding my coding knowledge, learn new languages and create fully functional, tested and beautifully designed programmes which are reusable and expansive, as well as being able to work alongside others who are also passionate about technology.
